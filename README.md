# ParkingSpaceDetector
This was the code for the capstone project made by myself and my partner, Jacob. We created an android application along with a sensor that detected if parking spaces were available and then display which spaces were available and which were taken. The app allowed users to also reserve a space. All of this information updated via the internet and saved in an sql database.
MainActivity.java: This is a java file from the andriod application that is the main screen.

Menu.java: This is from the mobile app as well it is the first page which just allows you to enter the main activity.

SplashScreen.java: This is the splash screen that is on the first few seconds.

activity_main.xml: The layout file for the main activity.

activity_menu.xml: The layout file for the menu activity.

activity_splash_screen.xml: The layout file for the splash screen.

colors.xml: This is the defualt xml with the app but it has been modified for more colours.

hello.c: This is the C file that programs the wifi module  ESP-01 and the ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04.

parkingspaces.db: This is the database file that was used. 

parkingspaces.php: This displays the parking spaces in a table. It is not neccessary as it all displays in the app but it is used to further verify that it all works.

strings.xml: This is from the app it is the default xml file but also with modifications.
